This project is a recreation of Asteroids, a 1979 space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game. A fun fact is that Asteroids was one of the first major hits 
of the golden age of arcade games; the game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. This solo 
project was developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning 
as well as to have fun!    

In Asteroids, the player controls a spaceship that can thrust forward, as well as turn left and right and fire at any approaching asteroids. The goal of the 
game is to survive as long as possible in the asteroid field by blasting or dodging any asteroids that come at you. Every 10000 points will award a bonus ship/life, 
good luck!

- **Space** or **Left Mouse Click**: Shoot
- **R**: Restart Round (If Gameover)
