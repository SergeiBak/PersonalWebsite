This project is a recreation of the sidescrolling hit know as Flappy Bird! This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series where I 
utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!     

Flappy Bird consists of a simple scrolling level in which the player can tap to make the bird jump up from its fall. The goal of the game is to get the highest 
score possible by avoiding hitting the ground & pipes. For each pipe passed, the player gets a point added to their score!        

## Controls    
- **Spacebar** or **Left Mouse Click**: Jump
