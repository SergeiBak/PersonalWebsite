This project is a recreation of the classic fixed shooter arcade game known as Centipede, originally released in 1981. This solo project was developed in Unity 
using C# as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!      

Centipede consists of a field of mushrooms, in which the Player is constrained to the bottom 'home zone' section of the play area. For each wave, the Player's 
goal is to defeat the centipede which makes its way down the field from the top of the screen. Each centipede segment that is shot turns into a mushroom, and 
shooting a centipede in the middle segment will cause it to split into two separate centipedes. Along the way, the Player will also encounter other enemies 
such as the spider, each with their own unique purpose/role in the game... Blast away and have fun seeing how long you survive!
