# *Minigames Collection*

## Description
*Minigames Collection* is an ongoing project that consists of various games developed in Unity using C#. These are all small games developed by myself using resources that I find on the web, a lot of these will be clone projects of games I enjoyed playing growing up as a kid. The goal of this is to learn and have fun!
