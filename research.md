# Research

My research group T4G (Tech for Good) now has its own web page at [https://t4guw.github.io/www/](https://t4guw.github.io/www/)

## Research Areas

- Computer Science Education: How can we teach better, provide better feedback to learners, scaffold independent learning, understand common mental bugs, build automated and semi-automated systems to improve productivity

- Video Games: Building more realistic and engaging non-player characters, providing novel user experiences, better graphics, better scalability, better interaction

- Artificial Intelligence: Systems that can explain their reasoning, answer what-if questions, learn from a few examples, be collaborators rather than blunt tools.


## Past Projects

(TODO: Abstract for each project and publications)
