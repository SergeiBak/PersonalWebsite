This project is a recreation of the good old Tetris, a timeless classic played by at least a billion people (fun fact). This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as 
part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!   

Tetris consists of a 10x20 grid, in which you are given blocks of various shapes (known as tetrominos) that are constantly falling downward, and it is up to you to shift 
them into lines that get cleared/destroyed whenever a row is full. As the level increases more and more (from level 0), the blocks fall faster increasing difficulty (and score earned).

## Controls   
- **A** or **Left Arrow**: shift left   
- **S** or **Down Arrow**: shift down   
- **D** or **Right Arrow**: shift right   
- **Q**: rotate left    
- **E**: rotate right   
- **Spacebar**: lock piece
