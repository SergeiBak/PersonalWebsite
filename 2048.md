This project is a recreation of a certain childhood game I used to play on Cool Math Games called 2048. This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!   

2048 consists of a 4x4 grid, in which you can move all of the blocks on the grid in one direction using keyboard input. Combine blocks to increase your score! If you run out of space on the grid you lose.   

## Controls 
- **W** or **Up Arrow**: shift up   
- **A** or **Left Arrow**: shift left   
- **S** or **Down Arrow**: shift down   
- **D** or **Right Arrow**: shift right
