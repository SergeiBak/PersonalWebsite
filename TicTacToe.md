This project is a recreation of Tic Tac Toe, a game whose first print reference is sourced back to 1884! A fun fact is that three-in-a-row board games can be 
traced back to ancient Egypt as early as 1300 BC. This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series where I utilize various 
resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!     

In Tic Tac Toe, one player represents X, and the other represents O. Each player takes turns marking a empty spot on the 3x3 board until one wins by marking 3 
boxes in a row with their symbol (Horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or until the board is out of space resulting in a draw.
