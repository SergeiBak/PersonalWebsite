# Suggestions for an Improved Approach to the Cross Reality Collaborative Framework

## Thomas M. Brown

This report builds upon the previous iteration of the Cross Reality Collaborative Frame-
work (CRCF) proposed by Doctor Kelvin Sung in early 2017. The work accompanying this
report analyzes the contributions presented in the original publication for the Cross Real-
ity Collaborative Framework and generates suggestions regarding its potential improvement.
A restructuring of the framework to incorporate dimensionality is accompanied by specic
denitions of the variable values of state and control that can be encountered for the ele-
ments of interaction described. In order to detail and explore the suggestions made in this
study, three stages of development are discussed. The rst stage is a general overview of the
academic corpus involving Mixed Reality applications, frameworks, and technologies. The
second stage of development is a restructuring of CRCF utilizing clearer element denitions
and explicit state and control boundaries. The nal stage involves a qualitative assessment of
the changes to CRCF by reviewing user interactions with applications in both an academic
and commercial setting. Additionally, several small programs were developed throughout
the course of this work that aimed to assist discussion, provide examples for CRCF element
state or control values, and provide a demonstration of coding ability. These applications
are briefly described to elucidate their functionality and contribution. General trends of
CRCF signature designations will follow application interaction review to close the paper
and highlight noted areas of improvement for CRCF as a result of the suggestions made in
this work.
