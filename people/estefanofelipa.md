# Kyflex Backend Development Internship

## Estefano Felipa

For my capstone project, I worked as a Backend Developer Intern at KyFlex. KyFlex is a startup based in Columbus, OH, that seeks to develop a web and mobile platform that allows users to explore and share experiences. These 'experiences' refer to activities that experts can share in a one-to-one or group setting.

 

My goal for the capstone was to learn more about the software development life cycle (SDLC), work on a project that provides ownership and high impact, and get a valuable leadership opportunities.

 

As a backend engineer on the backend team, I developed code for the server side of the web application using Django REST Framework for API development. During this internship I worked with different web development tools: Django REST Framework, a Python Framework that allows the secure and flexible development of web APIs, Docker for environment containerization, and PostgreSQL, a relational database that integrates perfectly with Django.

 

During my internship, I implemented and contributed several features and fixed multiple bugs for their code base. I primarily worked with Django, developing RESTful APIs as well as implementing major features like token-authentication, payment implementation, and docker containerization.

 

My internship at KyFlex helped me improve as a software developer as well as introduced me to a fast-paced like-minded startup environment. I was able to work with different developers and experts in many fields that just inspired me to work harder and smarter every day. I learned to design, develop, and expose RESTful APIs, collaborate asynchronously when working remotely as well as improve usability by focusing on the customer. Finally one of the most important things I learned is to be highly adaptable when working in new environments.

 

At the end of my capstone, I received an offer to continue working at KyFlex during the Fall, and I accepted. After getting a taste of what the software development industry is like, I have narrowed down what I want to specialize and pursue in the future.
