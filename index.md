Sergei Bakharev is a CSS student at the [University of Washington](https://www.uwb.edu/) majoring in [Computer Science & Software Engineering](https://www.uwb.edu/bscsse). Previously, he was a full time Running Start student attending [Everett Community College](https://www.everettcc.edu/) for an [Associate in Arts and Sciences Direct Transfer Degree](https://www.everettcc.edu/files/programs/aas-dta-transfer-guide.pdf) during his remaining two years of high school. 

His research interests include enabling technologies for computer games, the design of virtual environments that support collaborative work, and computer science education. He founded the [Australasian Conference on Interactive Entertainment](http://ieconference.org/) conference series and helped foster the Australian games community. His list of publications can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eCpI_aUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Yusuf has a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from Northwestern University. Before moving to Seattle in 2017, Yusuf lived in Chicago area for 10 years and in Sydney for 20 years.

My [somewhat outdated CV](PisanYusuf-CV.pdf) has additional details.

Happy to accept connection requests on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pisan/) as long as we have met in-person. I sporadically use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yusufpisan).

## Research

[Research](research.html)

[CSS 497 Capstone](capstone.html) guidelines, advice and [project ideas](capstone-ideas.html). Past [students](./people) I have supervised.

## Teaching

I have taught small classes, large (700-person) classes, first-year classes, graduate level classes, supervised masters and PhD students, experimented with hybrid and online classes, used traditional lecturing, active learning, flipped classrooms, collaborative meaning making and gamified classrooms. I received the [UTS Teaching Award](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/awards-and-citations/past-award-and-citation-0) in 2006.

I have decided to make all my evaluations public to help future students make more informed choices, or at least know what they are getting into when they decide to take a course from me. It also is an interesting and fun historical record! Happy spelunking into my [teaching evaluations](teaching/evaluations/) going back for many many years.
