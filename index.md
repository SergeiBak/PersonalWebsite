Sergei Bakharev is a CSS student at the [University of Washington](https://www.uwb.edu/) majoring in [Computer Science & Software Engineering](https://www.uwb.edu/bscsse). Previously, he was a full time Running Start student attending [Everett Community College](https://www.everettcc.edu/) for an [Associate in Arts and Sciences Direct Transfer Degree](https://www.everettcc.edu/files/programs/aas-dta-transfer-guide.pdf) during his remaining two years of high school. 

His research interests encompass a wide range of technologies; such as game development, web design, cybersecurity, NFT's/Blockchain, and much more! He has experience developing in a multitude of languages including C++, C, C#, HTML, and Java. Having lead multiple software development teams, Sergei takes great pride in developing quality software projects through agile, sprint based teamwork. 

Sergei is projected to graduate with his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Software Engineering in Spring 2022. Before moving to Lake Stevens in 2012, Sergei lived in Renton for about 11 years.

## Education

[Research](research.html)

[CSS 497 Capstone](capstone.html) guidelines, advice and [project ideas](capstone-ideas.html). Past [students](./people) I have supervised.

## Personal

I have taught small classes, large (700-person) classes, first-year classes, graduate level classes, supervised masters and PhD students, experimented with hybrid and online classes, used traditional lecturing, active learning, flipped classrooms, collaborative meaning making and gamified classrooms. I received the [UTS Teaching Award](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/awards-and-citations/past-award-and-citation-0) in 2006.

I have decided to make all my evaluations public to help future students make more informed choices, or at least know what they are getting into when they decide to take a course from me. It also is an interesting and fun historical record! Happy spelunking into my [teaching evaluations](teaching/evaluations/) going back for many many years.
