This project is a recreation of Snake, one of the most popular games that developers love to recreate. This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as 
part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!      

Snake consists of a moving line that the player controls. As it consumes more apples, it grows in size and speeds up, making it more difficult to dodge 
walls as well as itself. See how big you can grow your snake!     

## Controls    
- **W** or **Up Arrow**: Move up
- **A** or **Left Arrow**: Move left
- **S** or **Down Arrow**: Move down
- **D** or **Right Arrow**: Move right
