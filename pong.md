This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game known as Pong, one of the first ever computer games released in 1972! This solo project was 
developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!       

Pong consists of two paddles on either sides of the screen & a ball. The goal is to deflect the ball from going into the goal on your side of the board. Get the 
ball into your opponents goal to score! I have setup a single player mode in which you have control over one paddle against the computer, and a two player mode 
where you have control over both paddles.        

## Controls    
- One Player:
  - **W** or **Up Arrow**: Move paddle up    
  - **S** or **Down Arrow**: Move paddle down 
- Two Player:
  - Player 1:
    - **W**: Move paddle up 
    - **S**: Move paddle down 
  - Player 2:
    - **Up Arrow**: Move paddle up 
    - **Down Arrow**: Move paddle down
