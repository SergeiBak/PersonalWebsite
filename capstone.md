## Process

1. Check your eligibility for CSS 497. Check whether I am a good fit to supervise your capstone (completed a course with me, topic in my research area, etc). Have a look at the abstracts from [students](./people)whom I have supervised.

2. Explore capstone project options and talk to CSS 497 coordinator if necessary

3. If you are doing a faculty research, we need to discuss the project in detail before the
contract. For all other types of capstone, skip the next couple of steps and send me the
CSS 497 contract.

4. Send me an email with a 1-3 paragraph description of your project OR if you do not have
a project idea a list of areas you are interested in and description of what areas you are
good at. Describe the benefits of the proposed project (e.g., ‘What is this project going to
accomplish?’) and the academic merit of proposed project (e.g. 'How will the project help
you develop your core and advanced technical competencies). Specify at least 3
dates/times you can meet

5. Have a meeting to discuss the project

6. Download "CSS 497 Contract", fill it and sent it to me via email.
- Choose CR/NC as the grade
- Project plan must include a schedule with deliverables. It is not mandatory that
you meet the schedule precisely, but you should have a plan before you start.
Your plan should encompass 400 hours of work.
- Method and Criteria for Evaluation must include: Deliverables to your sponsor (if
any), Regular reports, Colloquium slides + poster, Colloquium Abstract and
Successful completion of the CSS colloquium.

7. If necessary, revise the contract based on my feedback and resubmit.

## Reports

Submit weekly progress reports for faculty research, fortnightly progress reports for all
other capstones. All reports should be submitted via Canvas when possible and have

1. Project Title
2. Your name
3. Report Number, Date and Colloquium Date when you will present
(e.g "Report 3, 1 Jan 2018, Colloquium Date: Jun 2018")
4. Activities - what you have done since last report max 7 bullet points.
5. Plans - what you plan to do next, max 5 bullet points
6. Problems - any problems encountered, can be N/A
7. Self Evaluation - towards capstone goals, max 1 paragraph
2. Final Report is due at the end of week 11. The report should be 5-10 pages.

A research based report will have:
1. Introduction
2. Method/Progress
3. Result
4. Conclusion/Analysis
5. Appendix: Final product and other support material (if applicable)

Other capstone project will have varying reports, but along the lines below:

1. Deliverables (pseudocode, code, requirement spec, design spec, testing
plans, testing results, diagrams, discussion, web site or something else that is appropriate
for your capstone)

2. Reflection
- What did you learn? What do you wish you would have learned?
- How did you enjoy what you're doing?
- Things that went well? Things that didn't go well? Things you would
change if you did it over?
- Was the mentoring handled well? Why or why not?
- What were the challenges in your project? Did you have to communicate with non-technical people? If so, how did it go?
- Problems? Cool things?
- Would you like to continue working at your internship company? Why or why not?

3. As long as you are working as a researcher, intern or on your project, you need to keep
submitting reports. Once you are done working, and only have the colloquium, then you do
not need to submit reports.

4. We will also have some meetings either face-to-face or via Zoom/Skype. For faculty
research, this will be approximately once a month. For all other capstones, this will be every
other month. If your capstone is only 1-quarter, we'll adjust this schedule.
You must attend at least one CSS Colloquium prior to your own presentation. Record the
colloquium dates in your calendar. If you have not attended a previous colloquium, you will not
be allowed to present.

## Colloquium

The typical schedule for colloquiuim is 11:30-12:30 poster presentations followed by 1:00-4:00 for oral presentations. This can change, so make sure you watch for emails from capstone coordinator.

1) Schedule will be posted at: [https://www.uwb.edu/bscsse/capstone/colloq-schedule](https://www.uwb.edu/bscsse/capstone/colloq-schedule)

3) Poster, presentation slides: Please submit it 7 days prior to the colloquium, so that we can review together. Poster will include (for example), background, related works, methods, experiments/results, and conclusion

4) Presentation slides: Make ~ 10 slides that include background (introduction), related works, methods, experiments/results, and conclusion etc.
