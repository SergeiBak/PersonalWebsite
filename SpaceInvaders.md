This project is a recreation of Space Invaders, a 1978 shoot 'em up style arcade game. A fun fact is that Space Invaders is actually the first fixed shooter 
game, and set the template for all of the shoot 'em up games that followed. This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series 
where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!      

In Space Invaders, the player controls a laser cannon that can move left and right, as well as fire at any approaching Invaders. The Invaders make their way 
towards the player by moving side to side, and dropping down a level every time they reach the edge of the screen. The goal of the game is to blast away as many 
waves of Invaders as possible! But beware, the less Invaders left, the faster they speed up!    

## Controls    
- **Space** or **Left Mouse Click**: Shoot
- **R**: Restart Round (If Gameover)
