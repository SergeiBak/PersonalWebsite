# Capstone and Project Ideas

Below are some potential capstone and project ideas.
I am open to supervising a much broader range of capstone topics. I prefer students who have already
taken some of my courses, and have done well in them, but even if you did not shine in the classroom,
you can still pitch your project. See past capstone projects

# Computer Science Education

- Novice programmers have lots of misconceptions on how the prohram works.
Until those misconceptions are identified and corrected, these students will continue to
struggle.
  - Create a large catalog of misconceptions.

  ]
  - Take 3-5 misconceptions and create diagnostic tools for identifying
  if a student has those misconceptyions or not. The diagnostic tool can be a web based survey,
  an interview or in some other format.
  - Create a set of web-based, self-guided exercises where
  students can examine their own misconceptions and correct them.
  
- Feedback is crucial to learning, but students often receive limited feedback. There are 
industrial strength tools that can be used to provide feedback, but these tools often
produce cryptic messages which confuse novice programmers even more.
  - There are many systems that test a given program on a large set of possible inputs
  to determine if the program is correct, such as [zybooks](https://www.zybooks.com/), 
  [leetcode](https://leetcode.com), etc. These systems are useful because they are easy to build,
  but do not incorporate any pedagogical knowledge. They have no way of guiding a student to a suitable
  next problem based on the types of mistakes (or misconceptions) observed. There is much that can be done in this area.
  - For novice students, using complex tools to analyze programs can be difficult and frustrating. 
  Create a web-based system that can enforce and check the assignment constraints. For example, 
  an instructor might want the assignment submitted as an `ass.zip` file with specific files in it
  whereas another instructor might request individual files to be uploaded. Creating a language (i.e. simple
  configuration file) that can be used by instructors and a front-end that can check students' will be useful.
  
- We need to attract and retain nontraditional CS students. There is work to be done at university, high school,
and middle school levels as well as societal perceptions. [Research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0163853X.2015.1136507)
shows that facts alone are not sufficient to change beliefs. Explore how we can change beliefs about CS at 
any of the levels.
